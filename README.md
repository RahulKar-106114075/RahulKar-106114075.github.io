Spider Web Development Task#1

Hi everyone! This is Rahul from CSE department.
I live in West Bengal and love listening to music.
I had some knowledge of HTML and CSS,but had no introduction to javascript.So it was really helpful in learning cool stuff.
Lastly the mentors are really helpful.
Thank You for all your stuff.
Waiting for other challenging projects!
